# Missing Draft Implementations

This file tracks the `WIO` subtypes that are missing from the `DraftBuilder` API.

- [ ] `Fork` (for conditional logic)
- [ ] `Parallel` (for concurrent execution)
- [ ] `HandleError` / `HandleErrorWith` (for error handling)
- [ ] `Checkpoint` (for saving progress)
- [ ] `Pure` (for simple value-based steps)
- [ ] `FlatMap` / `AndThen` (for sequential composition - may not require explicit draft helpers)
