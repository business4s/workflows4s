**Workflows4s** is a library that helps in building long-running stateful processes sometimes called workflows. It tries
to merge Temporal's execution model, BMPN rendering and native event-sourcing while removing the most of the magic from the
solution.

See the [**Website**](https://business4s.github.io/workflows4s/) for details and join our [**Discord
