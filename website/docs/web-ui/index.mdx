# Web UI & API

Workflows4s includes an experimental UI that lets you inspect and interact with workflows.
It is powered by an HTTP API that can also be used on its own.
Check the [demo](demo) to see how it works in practice.

:::warning
**Neither the UI nor the API provides authentication or authorization.**
Until this changes, we advise protecting it through external means.

:::warning
These modules should be treated as **early developer preview**.
They are safe to use, but their quality may be lower than the rest of the project.
