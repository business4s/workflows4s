# HTTP API

Workflows4s HTTP API aims to expose comprehensive information about the workflows. This means

* inspecting workflows definitions
* inspecting and searching among workflow instances
* interacting with instances through signals

It's available through the following dependencies

<SbtDependencies deps={[
    {moduleName: "workflows4s-web-api-shared", comment: "Endpoint definitions and models"},
    {moduleName: "workflows4s-web-api-server", comment: "Server implementation"},
]}/>

See [Getting Started](./index.mdx#getting-started) for the example usage.

## Workflow Entries

To expose its functionalities, API relies on `WorkflowEntry`,
a dedicated object that enriches a `WorkflowRuntime` with additional information required to serve the API.

It consists of the following elements:

* Workflow runtime - grants access to the instances
* Name & description - used for display purposes
* State encoder - used for rendering current instance state into json, that can be later presented to the user.
* Signal support - For each signal provides request json schema schema (so a form can rendered in the UI generically) and
a way to deserialize request and serizalize the response, allowing for exchanging those with the client

:::warning
Current API for `SignalSupport` is not type safe and might change in the future.

## Workflow Search

`WorkflowSearch` is an interface allowing searching among workflow instances and is meant to be implemented by workflow registries.

Currently, only in-memory implementation is provided, while other implementation might come later on.
Users are encouraged to create their own and contribute them to the project if they are generic enough.

## Compatibility guarantees

:::warning
Current API is in experimental phase and **no compatibility guarantees are provided**.
We advise to use the API through tapir definitions,
consume it from scala-js and ensure version match between the client and the server.
