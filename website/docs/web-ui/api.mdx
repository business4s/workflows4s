# HTTP API

The Workflows4s HTTP API exposes comprehensive information about workflows, including:

* inspecting workflow definitions
* inspecting and searching workflow instances
* interacting with instances through signals

It is available through the following modules:

<SbtDependencies deps={[
    {moduleName: "workflows4s-web-api-shared", comment: "Endpoint definitions and models"},
    {moduleName: "workflows4s-web-api-server", comment: "Server implementation"},
]}/>

See [Getting Started](./index.mdx#getting-started) for an example usage.

## Workflow Entries

To expose its functionality, the API relies on `WorkflowEntry`,
a helper that enriches a `WorkflowRuntime` with additional information required to serve the API.

It consists of the following elements:

* Workflow runtime - grants access to instances
* Name and description - used for display purposes
* State encoder - renders the current instance state to JSON for display
* Signal support - for each signal, provides a request JSON Schema (so a form can be rendered generically in the UI) and
  codecs to deserialize the request and serialize the response, enabling exchanging them with the client

:::warning
The current API for `SignalSupport` is not type-safe and might change in the future.

## Workflow Search

`WorkflowSearch` is an interface for searching workflow instances and is intended to be implemented by workflow registries.

Currently, only an in-memory implementation is provided; other implementations may come later.
Contributions of reusable implementations are welcome.

## Compatibility guarantees

:::warning
The API is experimental and **no compatibility guarantees are provided**.
We recommend using the API via the Tapir definitions,
consuming it from Scala.js, and ensuring the client and server versions match.
