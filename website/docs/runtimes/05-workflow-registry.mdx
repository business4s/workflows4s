# Collecting Instances

The `WorkflowRegistry` component is responsible for collecting instances and their execution status.
By providing `WorkflowRegistry.Agent` to the `WorkflowRuntime` you enable registering status changes.

This allows you to build a reliable store of instances that can be later queried for various use cases.

## Available Implementations

`Workflows4s` doesn't try to build a comprehensive implementation of `WorkflowRegistry`. Instead, it exposes a straightforward API that can be
implemented by the user.
Having said that, some simple implementations are provided:

* **NoOpWorkflowRegistry** - a default one, doesn't store anything.
* **InMemoryWorkflowRegistry** - stores all the created instances in memory.
* **PostgresWorkflowRegistry** - a simple reference implementation that allows to query for instances that are running for a particular period of time.

## Interrupted Executions

Whenever execution is interrupted
(e.g. `WorkflowInstance#wakeup` was called but the process was killed before processing finished)
the workflow requires re-executing the `wakeup` to continue processing.

`PostgresWorkflowRegistry` is a simple implementation leveraging `WorkflowRegistry.Agent` to collect all the instances that
started processing some time ago and has not finished yet.

It requires [migration](https://github.com/business4s/workflows4s/blob/main/workflows4s-doobie/src/main/resources/schema/postgres-workflow-registry-schema.sql)
to be applied by the user.
