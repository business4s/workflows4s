# Database Runtime

`DatabaseRuntime` provides a simpler, yet less powerful alternative to full-fledged event-sourcing solutions like Akka/Pekko.

It stores events in a database table without maintaining any state in memory. Each interaction with the runtime reads events
directly from the journal. This design results in higher latency but reduces memory usage.

## Usage

Follow these steps to use the `DatabaseRuntime`. Detailed explanations are provided in the sections below:

<SbtDependency moduleName={"workflows4s-doobie"}/>

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/doobie/DatabaseExample.scala start=doc_start end=doc_end
```

## Workflow Storage

Database runtime is database-agnostic but requires a database-specific component called `WorkflowStorage`.
This component is responsible for storing and reading events as well as locking the workflow.

Users are expected to implement custom storages that fit their needs.

### Postgres Storage

`PostgresWorkflowStorage` is a minimal, but fully functional storage relying on postgres advisory locks and assuming byte-based store.

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/doobie/DatabaseExample.scala start=doc_postgres_start end=doc_postgres_end
```

It requires the [migration](https://github.com/business4s/workflows4s/blob/main/workflows4s-doobie/src/main/resources/schema/postgres-schema.sql)
to be applied to the database by the user.

## Locking the Workflow

To understand why locking the workflow is important, consider the following scenario:

1. A workflow awaits two signals in parallel.
2. Both signals arrive simultaneously.
3. Only one path of the workflow can be followed.

To address this, workflows are locked, ensuring that only a single signal is processed at a time.
