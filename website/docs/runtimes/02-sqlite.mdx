# SQLite Runtime

`SQLiteRuntime` is a specialized runtime that follows the [extreme sharding](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/128919/extreme-sharding-one-sqlite-database-per-user) pattern, where a separate SQLite database is created for each workflow.

It stores events similarly to [`DatabaseRuntime`](02-database.mdx), but does not require any external infrastructure. The only requirement is access to the local file system.

## Usage

To use `SQLiteRuntime`, add the following dependency:

<SbtDependency moduleName={"workflows4s-doobie"}/>

Then refer to the example below:

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/doobie/SQLiteExample.scala start=sqlite_start end=sqlite_end
```

## Scaling
`SQLiteRuntime` has the theoretical ability to scale almost indefinitely due to its per-workflow sharding model.
However, the current implementation is not optimized for large-scale deployments.

1. **Use a network file system** (e.g., NFS, EFS) to enable shared access across machines.
2. **Distribute workflows into subdirectories** to avoid filesystem limits on the number of files in a single directory.
3. **Implement cleanup mechanisms** to delete or archive finished workflows over time.
4. **Use the [`WorkflowRegistry`](05-workflow-registry.mdx)** to keep track of workflow instances outside the filesystem. This component is already available and can help mitigate some discovery and indexing challenges.
5. **Consider volume sharding**, where workflows are distributed across multiple network-mounted volumes. This can help reduce contention and improve I/O scalability under high load.
6. **Plan for observability and monitoring** — with thousands of independent databases, getting system-wide visibility becomes non-trivial.

These enhancements are not yet implemented. If you're exploring large-scale usage or have relevant needs, please reach out — we’d love to collaborate.
