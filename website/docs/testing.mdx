# Testing

Workflows4s currently includes a minimal but growing set of testing utilities designed to make it easier to verify workflow behavior.
We're building it up gradually.
If there's something you'd like to see, drop us a note!

## Testing Utilities Overview

All utilities are in the `wio.testing` package and included in the `workflows4s-core` artifact.

* `TestClock` – Allows controlling the runtime-visible time, e.g., to trigger a timeout.
* `RecordingKnockerUpper` – Captures wakeups triggered by the workflow, useful for testing retries.

## Testing Approach

When testing workflows in Workflows4s, it's recommended to isolate workflow logic from external effects by placing business operations behind interfaces and mocking them.
This allows you to test the shape and event flow of the workflow deterministically using the `InMemoryRuntime` or `InMemorySyncRuntime`. These tests are fast, focused, and suitable for verifying state transitions and signal handling. For full confidence, users are also encouraged to write end-to-end tests that use real implementations and a real runtime to validate integration and correctness in realistic scenarios.
