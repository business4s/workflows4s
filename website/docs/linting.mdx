# Linting

Workflows4s includes a static linter that detects common issues in workflow definitions before runtime. Run it on your workflow definition to catch problems early.

## Usage

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/LintingExample.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

Each `LinterIssue` includes a path showing the location within your workflow tree (e.g., `root > flatMap > branch[approval]`).

## Built-in Rules

### `clashing-signals`

Detects when the same signal is expected in multiple parallel branches or in both a base workflow and its interruption trigger. This leads to ambiguity about which branch should handle the signal.

**Fix:** Ensure each signal type is only awaited in one branch at a time.

### `clashing-events`

Detects when the same event type can be generated in parallel branches. This causes non-deterministic recovery since the event could match multiple handlers during replay.

**Fix:** Use distinct event types for parallel branches, or restructure to avoid parallel event generation.

### `busy-loop`

Detects loops that contain no signals or timers. Such loops would spin indefinitely without waiting for external input.

**Fix:** Add a signal handler or timer inside the loop body.

### `unnecessary-error-handler`

Detects error handlers applied to workflows that cannot produce errors. This is harmless but indicates unnecessary complexity.

**Fix:** Remove the error handler, or verify the wrapped workflow actually needs error handling.
