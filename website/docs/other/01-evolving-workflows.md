# Evolving Workflows

Workflow evolution is crucial for long-lived systems, especially when workflows are expected to run continuously over extended periods. Workflows4s aims to handle workflow evolution through a combination of strategies:

1. **Checkpointing**: Marking segments of workflows as checkpointed, preventing the need for replaying those parts and enabling easier modifications.
2. **Journal Rewrites**: Modifying the persisted event journal.
3. **Versioning**: Running different workflow versions simultaneously.

## Compatibility Guide

Use the decision flowchart below to determine the optimal strategy for evolving your workflows:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

node0@{ shape: "hex", label: "Do you need to migrate in-progress instances?"}

node1@{ shape: "rect", label: "Introduce separate workflows (v1 & v2)"}
node0 --"No"--> node1

node4@{ shape: "rect", label: "Rewrite the journal"}
node0 --"Yes"--> node4

node2@{ shape: "hex", label: "Do you need access to historical workflow states?"}
node1 --> node2

node2 --"No"--> node5
node5@{ shape: "rect", label: "Wait until all v1 instances finish"}
node5 --> node8
node8@{ shape: "rect", label: "Remove v1 code"}

node6@{ shape: "rect", label: "Checkpoint entire v1 workflow"}
node2 --"Yes"--> node6

node7@{ shape: "rect", label: "Wake up all historical instances to persist checkpoint"}
node6 --> node7
node7 --> node5
```

## Impact of Workflow Changes

Below is a detailed explanation of how workflow modifications impact historical (already executed) workflows:

1. **Adding a Step:**
   - The newly added step will execute upon workflow wakeup, and its event will be appended to the end of the journal.
   - Currently, this might lead to incorrect recovery, as the event will be appended to the end of the journal. 
     Future enhancements to persistence/recovery mechanisms might address this issue.

2. **Removing a Step:**
   - Events previously recorded for the removed step will be ignored during recovery.
   - Workflow definition is always subject to typesafety constraints, hence next step input and logic has to accomodate the potentially missing data.

3. **Modifying Events:**
   - Changes to events, either in persisted or runtime form, typically don't affect workflows as long as events remain readable from the journal.

4. **Modifying Behavior:**
   - Functions within workflows (logic execution, state rebuilding, etc.) can safely be altered without backward compatibility concerns, provided the modifications remain logically consistent.

## Checkpointing and Recovery

For detailed instructions on checkpointing mechanisms and recovery procedures, visit the [Checkpointing documentation](/docs/operations/checkpoints/).

## Journal Rewrites

Journal rewrites involve directly altering the persisted event log to achieve a specific evolution outcome. Such operations include modifying, adding, or removing events. Currently, Workflows4s does not directly support journal rewrites due to their inherently complex and system-specific nature. Users performing journal rewrites should do so with caution and thorough testing.

## Automated Compatibility Detection (Planned)

Workflows4s may introduce tooling for automated detection of breaking changes, inspired by existing solutions such as [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/breaking/overview/).
