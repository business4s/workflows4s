# Production Readiness

Workflows4s began as a Proof of Concept to validate the approach and assess its technical feasibility. The initial
stages have demonstrated promising results, confirming the viability of this approach.
Now, we’re committed to making it production-grade, which might take some time.

The library is still under active development, and we’re working hard to make it more stable, add all the mandatory
features, and polish everything to production quality.

We’re aiming for an early release in Q1 2025.
Your feedback and ideas are a big part of making Workflows4s a solid and reliable tool.
