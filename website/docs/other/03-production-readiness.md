# Production Readiness

Workflows4s started as a proof of concept to validate the overall approach and assess its technical feasibility. The
early results have been promising, confirming the viability of the design.

We’re now focused on taking it to production-grade quality. This involves stabilizing the core, refining the developer
experience, and hardening the library for real-world use. It’s an ongoing effort, and we’re committed to doing it
right — even if it takes time.

All essential features are already available, and everything is thoroughly tested and expected to work reliably. That
said, the public API is still evolving and remains the most likely area to change as we incorporate feedback and improve
ergonomics.

The library is under active development and is currently available as snapshots via the Sonatype Snapshot repository. We
encourage early adopters to experiment and provide feedback.
