# Production Readiness

**Workflows4s has been officially released and is available for use.**
All major features are implemented and should work reliably in production environments.

That being said, the project is in a very early phase and some bugs and rough edges should be expected.

The API is likely to change as we continue to refine the library based on user feedback. There is
currently no binary compatibility guarantee between versions, so you should avoid building libraries on top of it.

We highly appreciate feedback and bug reports, which can be submitted through both GitHub issues and our Discord
community.
Your input is invaluable in helping us improve the library.
