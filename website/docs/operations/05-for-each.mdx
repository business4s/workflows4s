# Iterating Over Elements

The `forEach` operation enables workflows to process collections of elements by executing a sub-workflow for each element in parallel[^parallel-note].
This is useful for any scenario where you need to apply the same workflow logic to multiple items.

[^parallel-note]: Here, "parallel" means that timers and signals are processed concurrently in the workflow engine. However, this is not thread-level parallelism—no true multi-threading or asynchronous execution is involved.

The ForEach operation takes a collection of elements and embeds a sub-workflow execution for each element.
The ForEach step completes when all sub-workflows have finished.

## Usage Example

This element is one of the most complicated ones and requires you to configure quite a lot of various aspects:

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/ForEachExample.scala start=real_start end=real_end
```

<OperationOutputs name="for-each"/>


## Drafting Support

Iterating comes with [drafting support](20-drafting.mdx).

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/ForEachExample.scala start=draft_start end=draft_end
```

<OperationOutputs name="for-each-draft"/>

## Signals

ForEach operations support signal routing so that they can be sent to a specific element's sub-workflow.
This is exposed through `SignalRouter` abstraction which is split into two parts:

* `SignalRouter.Receiver` required when building the `WIO.ForEach`
* `SignalRouter.Sender` required to send the signal

Typically, both are exposed by the same object.

### Signal Router Types

#### SimpleSignalRouter

User `SimpleSignalRouter` when you have direct access to an element on the sender side.

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/ForEachExample.scala start=signal_simple_start end=signal_simple_end
```

#### BasicSignalRouter

For more complex routing scenarios, you can extend `BasicSignalRouter` to extract elements from sub-workflow state using custom keys:

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/ForEachExample.scala start=signal_basic_start end=signal_basic_end
```

## Considerations

* **Concurrency** - All element sub-workflows run concurrently by default. Consider the resource implications when processing large collections.
* **Error Handling** - If any element sub-workflow fails, the entire ForEach operation fails. Use appropriate error handling within your element workflows for resilience.
* **State Accumulation** - The interim state mechanism allows you to collect and aggregate results as sub-workflows progress, rather than waiting for all to finish before processing results.
