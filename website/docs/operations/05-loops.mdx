# Loops

Loops are essential for workflows that need to repeat actions until a condition is met. This operation enables iterative processing, such as retrying operations, processing collections of items, or implementing polling mechanisms that continue until specific criteria are satisfied.

:::warning

Loops without timers or signals will be effectively [busy loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting),
possibly causing journal growth and other problems.
Consider adding a short timer to slow it down.
In the future this will be detected by the [linter](https://github.com/business4s/workflows4s/issues/23).

## Drafting Support

Loops come with [drafting support](20-drafting.mdx).
