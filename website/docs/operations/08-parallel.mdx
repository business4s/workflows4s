# Parallel Flows

`WIO.Parallel` allows running multiple branches simultaneously, enabling scenarios such as waiting for a mix of signals and timers without enforcing a particular order.

All paths must incorporate their internal states into a global state (referred to as `InterimState`).

The final result is constructed from the outcomes of all paths.
Workflow's state is continously updated after each step completion (doesn't wait for all the paths to complete.)

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/ParallelExample.scala start=start_doc end=end_doc
```

## Drafting Support

When drafting workflows that need parallel execution, use `WIO.draft.parallel()` to run multiple branches concurrently with a simpler API:

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/DraftParallelExample.scala start=start_draft end=end_draft
```

<OperationOutputs name="draft-parallel"/>

The draft parallel operation simplifies the API by:
- Not requiring explicit interim state or result construction
- Not requiring explicit event handling
- Automatically generating names from the context if not provided
- Providing a more intuitive interface for running steps in parallel
