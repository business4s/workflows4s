# Parallel

`WIO.Parallel` allows running multiple branches simultaneously, enabling scenarios such as waiting for a mix of signals and timers without enforcing a particular order.

All paths must incorporate their internal states into a global state (referred to as `InterimState`).

The final result is constructed from the outcomes of all paths.
