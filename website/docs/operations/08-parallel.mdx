# Parallel Flows

`WIO.Parallel` allows running multiple branches simultaneously, enabling scenarios such as waiting for a mix of signals and timers without enforcing a particular order.

All paths must incorporate their internal states into a global state (referred to as `InterimState`).

The final result is constructed from the outcomes of all paths.
Workflow's state is continously updated after each step completion (doesn't wait for all the paths to complete.)

## Drafting Support

Parallel flows come with [drafting support](20-drafting.mdx).
