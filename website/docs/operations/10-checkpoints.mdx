# Checkpointing and Recovery

Elements described below are used primarily for evolving workflow, see the [dedicated docs](/docs/other/evolving-workflows/) for details.

## Checkpointing

Checkpointing allows
emitting a state-capturing event that during recovery marks as complete the wrapped part of the workflow.

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/CheckpointExample.scala start=start_checkpoint end=end_checkpoint
```

<OperationOutputs name="checkpoint" showBpmn={false}/>

## Recovery

Recovery allows processing an event.
The event has to be inserted into the journal outside the current workflow, e.g., by previous checkpointing or manual operations.

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/CheckpointExample.scala start=start_recovery end=end_recovery
```

<OperationOutputs name="recovery" showBpmn={false}/>
