# Drafting

Workflows4s comes with a dedicated API for creating renderable but NOT runnable workflow definitions.
Its goal is to allow defining the structure of a workflow that can be discussed with the team or stakeholders,
before committing more time to the actual implementation.

The entire drafting API is exposed under `WIO.draft` and documented alongside specific operations.

## Details

Drafts use exactly the same model under the hood as real definitions, but filled with dummy logic.

The drafting support simplifies the API in the following ways:

* Not requiring type parameters
* Not requiring event handling
* Not requiring run logic
* Automatically generating names from the context if not provided explicitly
* Making as many parameters as possible optional
