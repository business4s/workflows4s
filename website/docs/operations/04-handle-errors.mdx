# Handling Errors

Error handling is critical for building robust workflows that can handle non-happy paths. It allows for short-circuiting operations
and following an alternative path in the presence of expected but unusual situations.
It can be seen as a more convenient alternative to [Forks](/docs/operations/fork).

Errors defined and handled should be domain errors and not technical ones. Domain errors represent business-level exceptions that are meaningful in your workflow context, rather than implementation-specific exceptions like network failures or timeouts.

## Drafting Support

For Error Handling, no dedicated draft API is required. Drafting can be done using the standard API.
