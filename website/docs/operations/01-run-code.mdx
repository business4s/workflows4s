# Executing Logic

Workflows4s supports two ways of embedding custom logic within a workflow:
1. **Deterministic (Pure) Operations** - operations that always produce the same output for the same input, without any side effects
2. **Nondeterministic Operations** - operations that may produce different outputs for the same input, typically involving side effects

Deterministic operations are executed with each workflow recovery,
while nondeterministic ones are memoized through event persistance.

## Deterministic (Pure) Operations

### Without Error

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/PureExample.scala start=start_withoutError end=end_withoutError
```

<OperationOutputs name="pure"/>

### With Error

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/PureExample.scala start=start_withError end=end_withError
```

<OperationOutputs name="pure-error"/>

::::note

Unnamed pure elements are considered technical in nature and are not rendered in diagrams.
To make them visible, use `.named("Name")` or `.autoNamed`.

## Nondeterministic Operations (Side Effects)

Nondeterministic operations involve side effects like API calls, database operations, or other external interactions.
These operations need special handling because they shouldn't be re-executed during workflow recovery.

:::info

Workflows4s currently supports onyl cats-effect IO. If you're interested in other effect systems, please check [here](https://github.com/business4s/workflows4s/issues/59).

### Without Error

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/RunIOExample.scala start=start_withoutError end=end_withoutError
```

<OperationOutputs name="run-io"/>

### With Error

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/RunIOExample.scala start=start_withError end=end_withError
```

<OperationOutputs name="run-io-error"/>

::::note

Errors render in flowchart only when they are handled
