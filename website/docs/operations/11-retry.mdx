# Retrying Operations

Retries enable workflows
to automatically recover from transient technical failures by reattempting failed operations after a delay.

## Error Types: Technical vs Business

It's important to distinguish between:

- **Technical errors** – Infrastructure-level problems like network timeouts or service unavailability. These are typically transient and can be retried.
- **Business errors** – Domain-specific conditions like invalid input or failed validations. These require explicit handling and **should not be retried**.

Use [error handling](/docs/operations/handle-errors) for managing business errors.

## How Retry Works

When the `WorkflowInstance#wakeup` is called and the underlying operation fails:

- **Without retry**: the error is propagated to the caller.
- **With retry**: the error is swallowed, and a future wakeup is registered within [`KnockerUpper`](/docs/runtimes/knocker-uppers/) based on retry logic.

## Retry Strategies

### 1. Simple Retry with Fixed Delay

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/RetryExample.scala start=start_doc_simple end=end_doc_simple
```

<OperationOutputs name="retry"/>

### 2. Advanced Retry with Custom Logic

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/RetryExample.scala start=start_doc_full end=end_doc_full
```

## Caveats

### Retries Are Stateless

Currently, Workflow-level retries are **stateless**—they don’t track attempt counts,
elapsed time or any other information about executed retries.
This means you can't directly express rules like:

- "Retry at most 5 times"
- "Stop after 1 day"
- "Increase backoff time exponentially"

To support such logic, you can:
- Use custom persistent state to track retry metadata and query it in the retry handler.
- Manually clear the scheduled wakeup time via the `KnockerUpper` to stop future retries.

If you see it as a major limitation, please reach out.

### Choose the Right Layer

Use workflow-level retries for retry schedules spanning **minutes to hours or days**

For short-lived retries (e.g., retrying within milliseconds or seconds), prefer handling them directly inside the `IO` operation using libraries like [`cats-retry`](https://github.com/cats-effect/cats-retry).

## Drafting Support

Retries come with [drafting support](20-drafting.mdx).

```scala file=./main/scala/workflows4s/example/docs/draft/DraftRetryExample.scala start=start_draft end=end_draft
```
<OperationOutputs name="draft-retry"/>
